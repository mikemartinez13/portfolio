## Internship Experience
**Data Engineering Intern @ Johns Hopkins Supply Chain (_June - August 2024_)**

## Research Experience
**Undergraduate Researcher with William & Mary Dataphys**

My work under Cristiano Fanelli began in summer of 2023, with my first project focusing on Graph Neural Networks for particle track reconstruction. Since January 2024, I've been working closely with Prof. Fanelli and his PhD students to apply generative AI to reconstruct Cherenkov light patterns from the DIRC Detector at the Jefferson Lab. The investigation using VAEs and Normalizing Flows culminated in the [Deep(er)RICH paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07376), and I'm now investigating this problem using Diffusion models for my Honors Thesis and a possible publication.

## What am I Reading?
I'm truly an old soul, so I read in my free time. Here's what I'm reading right now: 

![The Making of the Atomic Bomb](/assets/making-of-atom-bomb.jpg)

A great historical and scientific overview of the discoveries, political context, and researchers that led to he discovery of fission and the creation of the bomb. Richard Rhodes does an incredible job at explaining nuclear chemistry in an exciting way to a general audience, and he gives amazingly nuanced biographies on each scientist, philanthropist, and politician.
